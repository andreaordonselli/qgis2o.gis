<h2>Reporting bugs</h2>
<br></br>
<p>Please report any problems you have with OpenGIS. Without this feedback, I
am often completely unaware that a problem exists. To ensure no time or effort
is wasted in bug reporting, please follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Make sure you are using the latest release of plugin</li>
    <li>Check the issues on Github to see whether the bug has already been
        reported, and if so, read through all the comments on the issue, and
        add any additional information from your experience of the bug</li>
    <li>Make sure you can reproduce the bug reliably</li>
    <li>Reduce the complexity of your bug conditions as far as you can,
        especially by reducing the number of layers, ideally to one</li>
    <li>Raise a Github issue, including:
    <ul>
        <li>only one bug per Github issue</li>
        <li>the plugin version</li>
        <li>any Python error text/stack trace which occurs</li>
        <li>browser JS console errors - press F12 in browser to open the 
            developer toolbar and find the console</li>
        <li>screenshot of your settings</li>
        <li>screenshot of the output</li>
        <li>a link to the data you used, if possible</li>
    </ul></li>
</ol>
<p>The stability of OpenGIS relies on your bug reports, so please keep them
coming.</p>
